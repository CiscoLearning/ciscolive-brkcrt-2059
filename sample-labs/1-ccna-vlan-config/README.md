# CCNA VLAN Config

This is a sample CCNA lab scenario.

## Implement Multiple VLANs and Basic Routing Between the VLANs

To complete this lab you must do the following:

* Implement VLAN assignments on two switches
* Configure a dot1q trunk between those switches
* Configure a dot1q trunk between one switch and a router that will handle the routing for the VLANs
* Configure VLAN trunking on that router to act as a gateway between VLANs
* Verify that connectivity exists between hosts in the lab on each VLAN, and that the connectivity goes through the router

Import the `topology.yaml` file to have a base with which to work.  If you get stuck, import the `topology-solution.yaml` file to see the fully working topology.
