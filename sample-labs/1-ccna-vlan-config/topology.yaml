    # CCNA: Implement Multiple VLANs and Basic Routing Between the VLANs
    In this lab you need to do the following:
    - Implement VLAN assignments on two switches
    - Configure a dot1q trunk between those switches
    - Configure a dot1q trunk between one switch and a router that will handle the routing for the VLANs
    - Configure VLAN trunking on that router to act as a gateway between VLANs
    - Verify that connectivity exists between hosts in the lab on each VLAN, and that the connectivity goes through the router
