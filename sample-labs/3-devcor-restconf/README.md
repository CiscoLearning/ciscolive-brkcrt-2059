This is a sample DEVCOR lab exercise.

To complete this lab you must do the following:

Retrieve the configuration with RESTCONF using Postman, and then add an IP address to Loopback0.

Import the `topology.yaml` file to have a base with which to work.  If you get stuck, import the `topology-solution.yaml` file to see the fully working topology.
